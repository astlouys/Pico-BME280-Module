# Pico-BME280-Module

Add-on C-Language module to merge with your existing (C-Language) project / program,
to support a BME280 sensor, using I2C communication protocol.

The BME280 sensor can read the temperature, the relative humidity and the atmospheric pressure.
Make sure the device you buy is a "real" BME280 since some BMP280 are sold under a BME280 tag.

You must not simply clone the repository to take advantage of this module. Please
read the User Guide and carefully follow the given instructions.

Enjoy !
